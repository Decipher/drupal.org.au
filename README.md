## Background
There has been various discussions and other efforts in the past around a "Drupal Australia" website. At Drupalcamp Melbourne 2015 (Nov 27th), there was  a session where details were discussed and a call to action made to create a community-driven project team to make it happen. 

## Objective
Create and maintain a site to support and promote the Drupal Austrlia community and eco-system.
